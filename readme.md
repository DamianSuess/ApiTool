# API Tool
Mini API Spy utility (_written in C#_) for discover details about windows as you mouse over them.

Ever have an invisible window on your desktop and you can't click in that region anymore?? _Slack-happens_ and you can't minimize or close windows. API Spy it to see who it belongs to and KILL IT!!

**_This project is a Work in Progress_**

Made one of these back in 1997, and who knew it would come handy again 22 years later
